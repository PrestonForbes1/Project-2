- Good afternoon everyone. Yada Yada

II. Functionality/TypeScript/Code Showing

- Components/Structure
	--

	- Used Forms and ReactiveForms module
	- ngSubmit triggers addToDoTask() method which collects the value of
	- the input element and stores it in a variable named value
	- used the length property to assign an ID
	- both properties get pushed/appended to an array activeTasks
	- the input element is reset

	- In order to display the activeTaskList, an *ngFor loop is used to iterate through
	- the List

	- the done button calls the method completeActiveTask()
	- a boolean isCompleted is defined and changes to true when button is clicked
	- task item is removed from list using splice() and removeActiveTask() is called and item being removed gets
	- added to completed task list

	- remove task methods are called when the delete button is clicked
	- item gets removed using slice()

	- future functionality will include an edit button for both active tasks and
	- completed tasks
	- more properties such as subtasks, time allocation, due date, etc can be implemented
	- some graphic that displays events/progress over time
